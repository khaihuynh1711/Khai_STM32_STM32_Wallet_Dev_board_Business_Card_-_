# 💳 Khai’s STM32 Wallet Dev Board Business Card
### *A Business Card That Actually Does Stuff*

**Ever been mid-debug and thought:**  
> “Dang… I just need *a few* clean PWM, *right now*.”

Or wished you had a **tiny, legit STM32 dev board** you could pull out of your wallet?

✨ **Say hello to the STM32 Wallet Dev Board.** ✨  
Yes, it’s a dev board.  
Yes, it fits in your wallet.  
Yes, it’s absurdly thin.
and Yes, it's powerful.

## 🚀 What makes it awesome?

- **Ultra-slim “sink-in” PCB design**  
  Components literally *sink into the board*, making this the **thinnest** STM32 dev boards out there.

- **Powered by the STM32H503**  
  Small board. Big brain. Serious performance packed into wallet size.

- **8 hand-picked “power pins”**  
  Carefully chosen MCU pins that cover *everything you actually need*:  
  **UART, SPI, I²C, PWM, ADC, DAC, and more**.

- **Built-in buttons & debug LEDs**  
  Because the best debug tools are already on the board.

- **USB Type-C**  
  Power it, program it, debug it - one cable.

- **STLINK-V3-MINIE onboard**  
  Full JTAG programming in a form factor that feels illegal (but isn’t).

##  Design Notes

- Most footprints are **fully custom**, made specifically for this board.
- While unconventional for typical designs, this mounting approach is purpose-built for this board, where minimizing thickness takes priority over traditional space constraints.
- Designed for a **1.0 mm PCB thickness** to perfectly match the USB-C connector and JTAG header.
- Can be made slimmer with thinner PCB (0.8mm) but will have to swap out the USB type C connector to be compatible with the PCB thickness.

##  Bottom line

This isn’t just a dev board.  
It’s a **conversation starter**, a **debugging lifesaver**, and a **wallet-sized flex** for anyone who loves electronics and embedded systems.
